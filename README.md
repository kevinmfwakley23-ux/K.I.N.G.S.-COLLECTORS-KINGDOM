# K.I.N.G.S. Collector's Kingdom

K.I.N.G.S. Collector's Kingdom is being built as a collector-first environment for cataloging and locating treasures, preserving ownership/provenance records, receiving evidence-backed intelligence, and eventually buying, selling, trading, discovering, valuing, insuring, and protecting collectibles through the wider Kingdom.

## Engineering status

Active milestone: **IMP-005 — Royal Vault, Phase 1**.

**Latest verified checkpoint:** the Royal Vault now includes permanent owner-scoped treasure records, hierarchical storage, secure private media, voice/talk-to-text, transactional JSON/CSV migration, a cross-device **Royal Intake Queue**, progressive camera barcode scanning, real review-only ISBN and UPC/EAN/GTIN catalog candidates, and an append-only **Provenance & Ownership Ledger** attached to permanent treasure UUIDs.

Latest verified code gate: **Kingdom Quality Gates #416** — run `33961966066` — **PASS** on commit `cc3e6dd7e25f15e3aece341bc30cd44b238b69b7`.

The provenance ledger supports collector-recorded acquisition, ownership notes, supporting documentation, loans/custody, sale/gift/trade, loss/stolen/recovery, and linked correction events. Ordinary PATCH/DELETE history mutation is deliberately unavailable. Every public entry remains labeled `collector-recorded` and `independentlyVerified: false`; storage does not magically authenticate a provenance claim.

The next engineering target is **Vault Reorganization & Bulk Stewardship**: owner-scoped collection rename/edit, safe nested-location rename/reparenting with cycle prevention, then previewed atomic movement of selected treasures between collection groups and physical locations without replacing permanent treasure IDs.

Evidence-backed current valuation, image recognition, broad category-specific catalog coverage, and Marketplace ownership transfers remain separate future milestones and are not represented as live.

## Durable engineering records

- [`docs/MISSION-STATEMENT.md`](docs/MISSION-STATEMENT.md) — permanent engineering mission and authority order.
- [`docs/MISSION-PROGRESS.md`](docs/MISSION-PROGRESS.md) — exact recoverable build state, verification evidence, limitations, and next target.
- [`docs/research/`](docs/research/) — dated competitor, standards, provider/API, GitHub, and technical reconnaissance used before meaningful build work.

After every substantial verified implementation milestone, `docs/MISSION-PROGRESS.md` must be updated so development can resume from the repository rather than depending on a chat session.

## Permanent engineering rules

- Build real, executable, production-oriented functionality; never present simulated integrations or decorative-only interfaces as complete features.
- Verify changes with the strongest available lint, contract, automated-test, production-build, artifact, and dependency-audit gates.
- Never fabricate collection totals, market values, Marketplace activity, notifications, identification certainty, provenance verification, or other domain data when no authoritative evidence exists.
- Never commit credentials, provider keys, access tokens, or secrets.
- Keep collector authority over destructive, ownership-changing, and authoritative record actions.
- AI and provider assistance must surface uncertainty rather than silently inventing an identification, value, provenance claim, or exact variant.
- Prefer portable data and provider-independent permanent Kingdom identities.
- Keep mobile, Chromebook, tablet, and desktop workflows first-class.

## Shared K.I.N.G.S. AI core

K.I.N.G.S. AI is the shared intelligence/router core for the K.I.N.G.S. application family. Collector's Kingdom owns collector identity, authorization, Vault records, Marketplace rules, ownership state, and product actions. AI model/provider routing stays behind the governed server-to-server K.I.N.G.S. AI boundary, and provider credentials never belong in browser code.

The Keeper can advise through K.I.N.G.S. AI, but Kingdom record mutations remain explicitly authorized by Collector's Kingdom and the collector.

## Great Hall

IMP-004 established the authenticated central Kingdom experience with personalized Great Hall, permanent castle-and-grounds geography, Royal Vault, Kingdom Street Market, real recent account activity, honest service availability states, quick actions, room-aware Keeper roles, and responsive royal-estate UI.

With the authoritative Vault wired, the Great Hall exposes `/vault.html` and reports real Vault record/unit counts instead of sample data.

## Royal Vault — verified capability

The Vault establishes one permanent treasure identity that later Marketplace, provenance, grading, transfer, insurance, legacy, and valuation services can reuse rather than duplicating item records.

Current verified capability includes:

- owner-scoped treasure create/read/update/archive;
- collection groups;
- arbitrary-depth physical storage such as room → safe → shelf → binder → page → pocket;
- condition, variant, quantity, acquisition, cost, identifiers, descriptions, notes, and custom attributes;
- normalized accent-tolerant search/filter/sort;
- duplicate candidate detection without destructive automatic merging;
- treasure/media/audit history;
- real record/unit/category statistics;
- purchase totals separated by currency;
- complete versioned JSON export including archived records;
- responsive Royal Vault browser workspace;
- The Keeper acting as Royal Curator.

### Secure treasure media

Private JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, AVIF, and PDF files are stored outside the public webroot with generated storage keys, file-signature/MIME/extension checks, owner authorization, storage limits, private retrieval, deletion, and audit events. No antivirus/sandbox/CDR capability is claimed.

### Voice command and talk-to-text

Where browser speech recognition is available, the Kingdom supports spoken navigation, Keeper questions, Vault search, safe treasure-entry commands, and dictation into selected fields. Typed controls remain available everywhere, and destructive voice commands are intentionally excluded.

### Transactional migration

The Vault accepts JSON and CSV migration sources through a review-first workflow with persistent preview batches, CSV mapping, validation/rejected/duplicate-review rows, explicit decisions, atomic all-or-nothing commit, stale-preview protection, idempotent retry, and no blind import writes.

### Royal Intake Queue & barcode scanner

Collectors can capture UPC, EAN, ISBN, catalog, serial, SKU, or custom identifiers from phone, Chromebook, or desktop into an account-scoped server-side queue. Repeated pending captures merge into a capture count and dismissed history is preserved.

On secure browsers exposing native `BarcodeDetector`, the Vault adds explicit Start/Stop camera capture, supported-format discovery, rear-camera preference, frame debounce, authenticated Intake Queue writes, and track shutdown on leave/background. Manual intake remains the fallback.

Camera permission is least-privilege: `/vault.html` receives `camera=(self)`, while ordinary Kingdom rooms and JSON APIs continue to receive `camera=()`.

### Review-only external catalog evidence

The provider-neutral catalog boundary supports:

- **Open Library** for low-volume checksum-valid ISBN/book candidate lookup;
- **UPCitemdb** for low-volume checksum-valid UPC/EAN/GTIN retail product candidates.

Provider access is bounded by validation, HTTPS-only external transport, timeouts, response-size limits, conservative serialized rates, caching, authenticated Kingdom routes, and explicit review semantics. Lookup itself never writes a treasure.

UPCitemdb provider prices, offers, merchant links/domains, and images are deliberately excluded from the identification model and cannot become Kingdom market value, trade value, or purchase price.

### Provenance & Ownership Ledger

Saved treasures now expose an append-only provenance timeline backed by `vault_provenance_events`.

Verified behavior includes:

- acquisition, ownership/provenance note, supporting-document, loan/custody, sale/gift/trade, loss/stolen/recovery, and correction events;
- effective date, counterparty/source, method, transaction amount/currency, reference, evidence URL, and notes;
- amount stored as integer cents with explicit currency;
- same-owner/same-treasure correction linkage;
- owner isolation;
- normal audit events for each append;
- no ordinary update/delete API;
- provenance survives treasure archive;
- export schema version 2 includes portable provenance events;
- responsive saved-treasure entry/timeline UI;
- explicit `collector-recorded` / `independentlyVerified: false` truthfulness policy.

## Truthfulness boundary

Market values remain absent until a real evidence-backed valuation service is implemented. A barcode, image, title match, external provider result, AI suggestion, ISBN match, catalog ID, receipt, certificate number, or collector-entered provenance statement is not automatically authoritative. Provider identifiers and supporting records may contribute evidence, but the permanent Kingdom treasure UUID remains the authoritative item identity.

## Current next target

**Vault Reorganization & Bulk Stewardship.**

The next Vault slice will let collectors safely rename collection groups, rename/reparent nested physical locations without cycles, preserve descendant paths and permanent treasure references, and then reorganize selected treasures through a previewed atomic bulk movement workflow. The first bulk slice will be non-destructive; mass archive/delete will remain a separately reviewed capability.
